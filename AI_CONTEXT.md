# Current Task Context

## ðŸŽ¯ Working on Issue #56

### Title: [HIGH] End-to-End Integration Testing

### Description:
## Problem
End-to-end user flows not tested. Need integration tests for:
- Complete creator flow (signup â†’ create space â†’ go live)
- Complete viewer flow (discover â†’ purchase â†’ watch)
- Access control enforcement
- Payment processing integration

## Required Work

### Creator Flow Tests
- [ ] Creator signup and onboarding
- [ ] Space creation and configuration
- [ ] Access pass creation
- [ ] Going live with stream
- [ ] Managing chat/moderation

### Viewer Flow Tests  
- [ ] Space discovery and browsing
- [ ] Access pass purchase (Stripe test mode)
- [ ] Waitlist application and approval
- [ ] Watching live streams
- [ ] Chat participation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Purchase â†’ Access Grant â†’ Stream Access flow
- [ ] Free vs paid access enforcement
- [ ] Subscription renewal handling
- [ ] Webhook event processing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All critical user paths have integration tests
- [ ] Tests use realistic data and scenarios
- [ ] Tests catch regressions
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline

## Estimated Effort
3 days

## Dependencies
- Test suite stable (issue #50)
- Access control verified (issue #51)
- Streaming working (issue #52, #53)

### Branch: issue-56

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Review issue requirements above
- [ ] Check NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md before creating models
- [ ] Run validation: `ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "command"`
- [ ] Use super_scaffold for all new models
- [ ] Follow PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md for routes
- [ ] Maintain team context where needed
- [ ] Write tests (Magic Test for UI, RSpec for models)
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## ðŸ”§ Common Commands:
```bash
# Validate namespacing
ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "rails generate super_scaffold ModelName"

# Generate model
rails generate super_scaffold ModelName ParentModel field:type

# Run tests
rails test
rails test:system

# Check changes
git status
git diff

# When complete
bin/gh-complete 56 "PR title describing changes"
```

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation:
- CLAUDE.md - Project instructions (MUST READ)
- NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md - Model naming rules
- TEAM_SPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md - Team/Space relationship
- PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md - Route structure
- AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORDLESS.md - Auth implementation

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes:
- Public routes do NOT need team context
- Primary subjects (Space, Experience, AccessPass, Stream) should NOT be namespaced
- Supporting models should be namespaced (Creators::Profile, Billing::Purchase)
- Always validate namespacing before generating models
