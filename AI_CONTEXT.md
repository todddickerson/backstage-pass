### Title: [CRITICAL] Fix Payment Processing - Complete Stripe Integration

### Description:
## Problem

Payment processing is currently broken with 6 failing tests due to missing service implementations. This blocks the core purchase flow essential for MVP functionality.

**Failing Tests:**
```
NoMethodError: undefined method 'any_instance' for class Billing::StripeService
```

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Missing Service Implementations
- [ ] Complete `Billing::StripeService` implementation
- [ ] Complete `Billing::PurchaseService` implementation  
- [ ] Fix service layer methods causing test failures

### 2. Purchase Flow Completion
- [ ] Stripe Elements integration working end-to-end
- [ ] Webhook handling for payment confirmations
- [ ] Automatic access pass activation after payment
- [ ] Email confirmations for purchases

### 3. Test Coverage  
- [ ] Fix 6 failing purchase flow tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive payment integration tests
- [ ] Mock Stripe responses properly

## Technical Requirements

### Service Layer Architecture
```ruby
# app/services/billing/stripe_service.rb
class Billing::StripeService
  def initialize(access_pass)
    @access_pass = access_pass
  end

  def create_payment_intent(amount_cents)
    # Stripe PaymentIntent creation
  end

  def process_webhook(event)
    # Handle payment confirmations
  end
end

# app/services/billing/purchase_service.rb  
class Billing::PurchaseService
  def initialize(user, access_pass)
    @user = user
    @access_pass = access_pass
  end

  def create_purchase(payment_intent_id)
    # Create purchase record and activate access
  end
end
```

### Controller Updates
- [ ] Complete `Public::PurchasesController` checkout flow
- [ ] Handle Stripe webhook endpoint
- [ ] Redirect to content after successful purchase

### Email & Notifications
- [ ] Purchase confirmation emails
- [ ] Access instructions for new buyers
- [ ] Receipt generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Purchase Flow Working
1. User clicks "Get Access" on access pass
2. Stripe Elements form loads correctly  
3. Payment processes successfully
4. User immediately gains access to content
5. Confirmation email sent
6. All tests passing âœ…

### Webhook Reliability
1. Stripe webhooks handled correctly
2. Failed payments handled gracefully
3. Duplicate webhooks ignored
4. Proper error logging

## User Stories Blocked

This issue blocks:
- **STORY 7**: Access Pass Purchase (40% complete)
- **STORY 8**: Live Stream Viewing (depends on purchase access)
- **STORY 10**: Account Management (subscription management)

## Priority

**CRITICAL** - This is the #1 blocker for MVP functionality. Users cannot purchase access passes without working payment processing.

config/routes.rb (webhook routes)
```

## Testing Plan

1. Fix existing failing tests first
2. Add integration tests with Stripe test mode
3. Test webhook handling thoroughly
4. Verify email sending works

## Estimated Effort

**2-3 days** for full completion including tests and email setup.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All payment tests passing
- [ ] Complete purchase flow working end-to-end
- [ ] Stripe webhooks handling all events
- [ ] Email confirmations working
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Ready for next story (Live Stream Viewing)

### Branch: issue-45

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Review issue requirements above
- [ ] Check NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md before creating models
- [ ] Run validation: `ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "command"`
- [ ] Use super_scaffold for all new models
- [ ] Follow PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md for routes
- [ ] Maintain team context where needed
- [ ] Write tests (Magic Test for UI, RSpec for models)
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## ðŸ”§ Common Commands:
```bash
# Validate namespacing
ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "rails generate super_scaffold ModelName"

# Generate model
rails generate super_scaffold ModelName ParentModel field:type

# Run tests
rails test
rails test:system

# Check changes
git status
git diff

# When complete
bin/gh-complete 45 "PR title describing changes"
```

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation:
- CLAUDE.md - Project instructions (MUST READ)
- NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md - Model naming rules
- TEAM_SPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md - Team/Space relationship
- PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md - Route structure
- AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORDLESS.md - Auth implementation

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes:
- Public routes do NOT need team context
- Primary subjects (Space, Experience, AccessPass, Stream) should NOT be namespaced
- Supporting models should be namespaced (Creators::Profile, Billing::Purchase)
- Always validate namespacing before generating models
