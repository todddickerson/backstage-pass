### Title: [HIGH] Complete GetStream Chat Integration

### Description:
## Problem
GetStream chat integration incomplete. ChatRoom model exists but chat functionality unverified:
- Unknown if channel creation works
- Unknown if token generation works  
- Unknown if chat UI implemented
- Unknown if moderation tools work

## Required Work

### Chat Implementation
- [ ] Implement GetStream channel creation per stream
- [ ] Generate user access tokens
- [ ] Integrate chat UI (JavaScript SDK)
- [ ] Test message sending/receiving
- [ ] Test real-time message updates

### Moderation Tools
- [ ] Implement creator message deletion
- [ ] Implement user banning
- [ ] Configure viewer-only permissions
- [ ] Test moderation controls

### Testing
- [ ] Multiple users chatting concurrently
- [ ] Moderation tools functional
- [ ] Chat persistence across page refresh
- [ ] Chat performance with many messages

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat appears when stream is live
- [ ] Users can send/receive messages
- [ ] Creator can delete messages
- [ ] Creator can ban users
- [ ] Chat performs well with 100+ messages

## Files to Review
- `app/models/streaming/chat_room.rb`
- `app/controllers/account/experiences_controller.rb` (chat_token method)
- Chat UI JavaScript files

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Dependencies
- GetStream credentials configured (DONE)
- LiveKit streaming working (issue #52)

### Branch: issue-53

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Review issue requirements above
- [ ] Check NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md before creating models
- [ ] Run validation: `ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "command"`
- [ ] Use super_scaffold for all new models
- [ ] Follow PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md for routes
- [ ] Maintain team context where needed
- [ ] Write tests (Magic Test for UI, RSpec for models)
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## ðŸ”§ Common Commands:
```bash
# Validate namespacing
ruby .claude/validate-namespacing.rb "rails generate super_scaffold ModelName"

# Generate model
rails generate super_scaffold ModelName ParentModel field:type

# Run tests
rails test
rails test:system

# Check changes
git status
git diff

# When complete
bin/gh-complete 53 "PR title describing changes"
```

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation:
- CLAUDE.md - Project instructions (MUST READ)
- NAMESPACING_CONVENTIONS.md - Model naming rules
- TEAM_SPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md - Team/Space relationship
- PUBLIC_ROUTES_ARCHITECTURE.md - Route structure
- AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORDLESS.md - Auth implementation

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes:
- Public routes do NOT need team context
- Primary subjects (Space, Experience, AccessPass, Stream) should NOT be namespaced
- Supporting models should be namespaced (Creators::Profile, Billing::Purchase)
- Always validate namespacing before generating models
