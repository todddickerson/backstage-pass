{"assignees":[],"body":"## Problem\n\nPayment processing is currently broken with 6 failing tests due to missing service implementations. This blocks the core purchase flow essential for MVP functionality.\n\n**Failing Tests:**\n```\nNoMethodError: undefined method 'any_instance' for class Billing::StripeService\n```\n\n## Critical Issues to Fix\n\n### 1. Missing Service Implementations\n- [ ] Complete `Billing::StripeService` implementation\n- [ ] Complete `Billing::PurchaseService` implementation  \n- [ ] Fix service layer methods causing test failures\n\n### 2. Purchase Flow Completion\n- [ ] Stripe Elements integration working end-to-end\n- [ ] Webhook handling for payment confirmations\n- [ ] Automatic access pass activation after payment\n- [ ] Email confirmations for purchases\n\n### 3. Test Coverage  \n- [ ] Fix 6 failing purchase flow tests\n- [ ] Add comprehensive payment integration tests\n- [ ] Mock Stripe responses properly\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### Service Layer Architecture\n```ruby\n# app/services/billing/stripe_service.rb\nclass Billing::StripeService\n  def initialize(access_pass)\n    @access_pass = access_pass\n  end\n\n  def create_payment_intent(amount_cents)\n    # Stripe PaymentIntent creation\n  end\n\n  def process_webhook(event)\n    # Handle payment confirmations\n  end\nend\n\n# app/services/billing/purchase_service.rb  \nclass Billing::PurchaseService\n  def initialize(user, access_pass)\n    @user = user\n    @access_pass = access_pass\n  end\n\n  def create_purchase(payment_intent_id)\n    # Create purchase record and activate access\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Controller Updates\n- [ ] Complete `Public::PurchasesController` checkout flow\n- [ ] Handle Stripe webhook endpoint\n- [ ] Redirect to content after successful purchase\n\n### Email & Notifications\n- [ ] Purchase confirmation emails\n- [ ] Access instructions for new buyers\n- [ ] Receipt generation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Purchase Flow Working\n1. User clicks \"Get Access\" on access pass\n2. Stripe Elements form loads correctly  \n3. Payment processes successfully\n4. User immediately gains access to content\n5. Confirmation email sent\n6. All tests passing âœ…\n\n### Webhook Reliability\n1. Stripe webhooks handled correctly\n2. Failed payments handled gracefully\n3. Duplicate webhooks ignored\n4. Proper error logging\n\n## User Stories Blocked\n\nThis issue blocks:\n- **STORY 7**: Access Pass Purchase (40% complete)\n- **STORY 8**: Live Stream Viewing (depends on purchase access)\n- **STORY 10**: Account Management (subscription management)\n\n## Priority\n\n**CRITICAL** - This is the #1 blocker for MVP functionality. Users cannot purchase access passes without working payment processing.\n\n## Related Files\n\n```\napp/models/billing/purchase.rb\napp/controllers/public/purchases_controller.rb  \napp/services/billing/\ntest/models/billing/\nconfig/routes.rb (webhook routes)\n```\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. Fix existing failing tests first\n2. Add integration tests with Stripe test mode\n3. Test webhook handling thoroughly\n4. Verify email sending works\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n**2-3 days** for full completion including tests and email setup.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] All payment tests passing\n- [ ] Complete purchase flow working end-to-end\n- [ ] Stripe webhooks handling all events\n- [ ] Email confirmations working\n- [ ] Code reviewed and merged\n- [ ] Ready for next story (Live Stream Viewing)","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOPu35oc8AAAACKadxOg","name":"ai/working","description":"AI currently working","color":"FFFF00"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPu35oc8AAAACKadyNQ","name":"status/executing","description":"In progress","color":"6F42C1"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPu35oc8AAAACKady0g","name":"priority/critical","description":"Blocking issues","color":"FF0000"},{"id":"LA_kwDOPu35oc8AAAACKadzdA","name":"type/feature","description":"New functionality","color":"0052CC"}],"milestone":null,"number":45,"title":"[CRITICAL] Fix Payment Processing - Complete Stripe Integration"}
