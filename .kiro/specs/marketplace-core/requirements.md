# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Backstage Pass is a marketplace platform that enables creators to monetize their content through various digital experiences. Creators can set up branded spaces, offer different types of experiences (live streams, chat, custom apps, website embeds), and sell flexible access passes to their audience. The platform supports multiple pricing models (free, one-time, recurring), waitlists, and provides high-quality streaming infrastructure. Users can discover content through public sales pages and access member experiences through a passwordless authentication system.
