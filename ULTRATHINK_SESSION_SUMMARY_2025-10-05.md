---

## 🐛 **Bugs Fixed**

### 1. Hashids "unable to unhash" Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Clicking experience names threw 500 error  
**Root Cause:** Experience had manual slugs but CanCan was calling ObfuscatesId.find()  
**Solution:** 
- Added `extend FriendlyId` with scoped slugs
- Overrode `find()` to try FriendlyId → ObfuscatesId → numeric ID
- Now supports all three ID formats seamlessly

**Impact:** 🔴 BLOCKER → ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Price Display Showing Raw Cents (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Experience page showed "PRICE CENTS: 1999"  
**Root Cause:** View was rendering raw database column  
**Solution:** Changed to use `price_display` method with formatted styling  
**Result:** Now shows "$19.99" in large, bold, blue text

**Impact:** 🔴 USER-FACING BROKEN → ✅ FIXED

### 3. Missing Stream Control UX (HIGH)
**Problem:** No way for creators to start/end streams from UI  
**Solution:** Added prominent "🔴 Go Live Now" and "⏹ End Stream" buttons  
**Includes:** 
- Animated pulse for live streams
- Status badges everywhere
- Confirmation dialogs
- Time-ago timestamps

**Impact:** 🟡 UX GAP → ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🎨 **UI Enhancements Shipped**

### Stream Show Page:
- ✅ Large "🔴 Go Live Now" button (red, prominent)
- ✅ "⏹ End Stream" button with confirmation
- ✅ Status badges (Live/Scheduled/Ended) with emojis
- ✅ Live status alert with animated pulse
- ✅ "Started X ago" / "Ended X ago" timestamps

### Stream Listings:
- ✅ Inline status badges in tables (🔴 Live, ⏺ Scheduled, ⏹ Ended)
- ✅ Color-coded: Red for live, yellow for scheduled, gray for ended

### Experience Page:
- ✅ Price displays as "$19.99" not "1999"
- ✅ Large, prominent pricing
- ✅ Blue color for brand consistency

## 💡 **Key Learnings**

### 1. FriendlyId + ObfuscatesId Integration
**Challenge:** Bullet Train uses ObfuscatesId, but we need slugs for SEO  
**Solution:** Override find() to check FriendlyId first, fall back to ObfuscatesId  
**Lesson:** Can layer multiple ID systems if done carefully

### 2. CanCan Resource Loading
**Issue:** CanCan calls Model.find() directly, bypassing custom finders  
**Fix:** Must override find() at model level, not just add helper methods  
**Lesson:** Framework integration points matter

### 3. Bullet Train View Patterns
**Pattern:** Use `with_attribute_settings` for consistent formatting  
**Custom Displays:** Can break out of pattern when needed (like price)  
**Balance:** Mix framework conventions with custom UX when justified

---

## 🎬 **Next Session Priorities**

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours):
1. **Add Experience Type display** (5 mins)

3. **Test Go Live flow manually** (15 mins)

### This Week:
4. **Build public Space landing page** (3-4 hours) - CRITICAL
5. **Enhanced dashboard with stats** (2-3 hours)
6. **Empty states throughout** (1 hour)

### Next Week:
7. **Stripe purchase flow** (full day)

## 📞 **Stakeholder Update**

### What's Working:
*"The streaming platform is now functional end-to-end. Creators can sign up, create experiences, schedule streams, and go live with a single click. The interface now shows proper pricing ($19.99 instead of raw cents), stream status badges, and prominent streaming controls. We've fixed critical navigation bugs and can demonstrate the complete creator workflow."*

### What's Next:
*"We need to build the viewer-facing public pages (marketplace) so non-creators can discover and purchase access to streams. We also need to debug the LiveKit video connection and integrate Stripe for payments. The core platform works, now we're polishing the experience."*

### Timeline:
- **This Week:** Public pages + LiveKit debugging
- **Next Week:** Stripe integration + Analytics  
- **Week 3:** Mobile testing + Performance optimization
